# AustinKeeseyLootGenerator


## Description
The loot generator is a list of possible loot. It has various loot types, loot elements, and loot themes. All of these aspects can be formed together to generate numerous possible loot combinations. 


## Overview
The Purpose of Random Loot Generator is to provide awesome different combinations of loot that the player can be entertained by. The program runs the different combinations of loot and then the program writes the random generation. It accepts input from the user by letting them specify whether they would like another shot at different generated loot by saying yes or no. 


## High Level 
1.) Prompts the user if they would like some epic loot
2.) Loads a list of the different types of loot
3.) Loads the list of the different elements of the loot
4.) Loads the list of the different themes of the loot
5.) Randomly selects a type, element, and theme
6.) Write the random selection of the three combinations to the console
7.) If more loot needs to be generated by the user saying yes to more loot, go back to step 2
8.) Otherwise, the program exits

2.) Generate a random number, TypeIndex, between 0 and Type.Count
3.) Generate a random number, ElementIndex, between 0 and Element.Count
4.) Generate a random number, ThemeIndex, between 0 and Theme.Count
5.) Combine the different aspects of the loot together
Type[TypeIndex] + " " + Element[ElementIndex] + " " + Theme[ThemeIndex];

### Tests

1. First the user opens the program
2. The user should press the start game button and the result should be the opening of another screen
3. While the user has arrived to the main screen, the user can press either the projectile or the melee weapon button
4. If the user clicks the projectile weapon button, the result should be a random projectile weapon sprite showing up. 
5. If the user clicks the melee weapon button, the result should be a random melee weapon sprite showing up. 
6. The program should print that the user found the resulting weapon
